## When do we write work report?

Since there were a lot of misunderstandings about each other's code, work report must be written for chunks of job you have done.<br/>
You **MUST** write a report in following cases:
1. when you are merging your working branch to master
2. when you pushed your work to this repo
2. when you saved your work without completing the job (probably always this case)
3. when there are some problems and special cases that has been caused by my work

For those cases, please do a favor of our team by writing a work report.

## How do we write work report?

Please write the report regarding to the following form **AT THE MASTER BRANCH**.

#### Name and file directory of the file
> root/WorkReport/(Current Date)_(My Name).md
> > ex) WorkReport/20200202_G1.md

#### Content of the file:
## Files (Write down on what branch, on what files you have worked on)
- BRANCH_NAME:FILE_DIRECTORY
- BRANCH_NAME2:FILE_DIRECTORY2
## Jobs (Write down what you have done)
- I wrote down this report
- I want to go home
## Problems (Write down problems you have experienced)
- Markdown didn't work well
- I don't know if this form is nice and clean
- I don't know if there will be more things that needs to be written
## Evils (Write down weird things that you have done so that everyone should be careful about it)
- I erased some file wooyoung had written
- I don't want to code anymore so I am fleeing with bugs left
## Plans (Write down what are you going to do next)
- Fix bugs in this report
- Decorate with css on `frontend/src/components/fake_file.js
